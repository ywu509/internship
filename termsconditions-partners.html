                upon request.</li>

        <p>11.7 The Merchant will immediately notify iCoffee if at any time it considers it will not be able to carry
            out its obligations under an Offer and the reason for such non-performance. For the avoidance of doubt, any
            notice given under this clause will not relieve the Merchant of the performance of its obligations under
            this Agreement. If iCoffee receives notice under this clause or otherwise reasonably considers that the
            Merchant may not be able to carry out its obligations under a (whether or not that Offer has been
            advertised), then iCoffee may give notice to the Merchant of its intention to immediately withdraw the

        <p>11.8 If the Merchant fails to honour any Offer (including delivery of goods to a Member, as applicable),
            iCoffee may give notice to the Merchant of its intention to immediately withdraw the Merchant’s Offer(s).
        </p>

        <p>11.9 In respect of any Offer, iCoffee and the Merchant agree that, in accordance with section 5(11G) of the
            Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, the time of supply for GST purposes will occur on the redemption of the
            Offer (i.e. when the Member uses the Offer to obtain the goods and/or services from the Merchant) instead of
            on the issue of the Offers by iCoffee. As such, the Merchant shall ensure that it accounts for GST on the
            provision of the underlying goods and/or services. iCoffee is not responsible for collecting, reporting or
            remittance of any GST in relation to sales made on behalf of the Merchant.</p>

        <p>11.10 The Merchant warrants that where it makes, or has made, an offer for the relevant goods and/or services
            (whether in print, online, in store or otherwise) that is similar to, or better than, an Offer, it will
            notify iCoffee and the relevant Offer will be deemed to be amended to match that other offer.</p>

        <p>11.11 Where the Merchant has entered into an offer agreement with iCoffee, that agreement shall come to an
            end on the later of the date of this Agreement or the date the last Offer Schedule entered into under that
            agreement is completed. Any Offer Schedule entered into after the date of this Agreement will be entered
            into on and subject to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
