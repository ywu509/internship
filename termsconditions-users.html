        <p class = 'document__subtitle'>3. iCoffee Benefits</p>
        <p>Each iCoffee Partner manages and operates its own rewards program that allows you to accrue points or credits by using your iCoffee Loyalty Card or the iCoffee Application. The relevant iCoffee Partner will advise you of how to earn points and how these can be redeemed.</p>
        <p>You will be able to select the different iCoffee Partners you wish to receive messages and other information about (Notes), these may include special promotions or offers (Promotions). A iCoffee Partner may send you Notes and Promotions through social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, SMS text messaging, notifications and other social media services that may be included from time to time (Social Media Tools) where you have given them the permission.</p>
        <p>You may unsubscribe at any time from receiving Notes or Promotions from iCoffee or (where applicable) any iCoffee Partner. For instance, you may like to only receive Notes or Promotions from one iCoffee Partner but you will still be able to redeem promotions from all iCoffee Partners and, where made available, participate in a reward program made available by a iCoffee Partner. Notwithstanding that you may have unsubscribed from receiving Notes or Promotions from iCoffee, iCoffee may still continue to contact you in relation to matters relating to your membership. If you do not want to be contacted at all you should notify iCoffee of this and iCoffee will cancel your membership.</p>
        <p>From time to time iCoffee Partners may offer iCoffee Offers on the Website and the iCoffee Application. Your iCoffee Login will give you limited access to iCoffee Offers at no cost to you. If you want unlimited access to all iCoffee Offers you may be required to subscribe for a premium membership by providing a valid, accepted method of payment, which you may update from time to time (Payment Method). Because of the cost, premium memberships will not be available for iCoffee Members that are under the age of 18 and iCoffee may refuse your premium membership until iCoffee is satisfied you are 18 or more years of age. Despite our reasonable endeavors, the iCoffee Offers available on the Website and the iCoffee Application may change from time to time and often due to reasons beyond our control. Before you upgrade to a premium membership, you should browse and view the full range of iCoffee Offers available to determine if the premium membership is right for you.</p>
        <p>To redeem a iCoffee Offer you will require internet connectivity (at your own cost). iCoffee Partners may specify their own terms and conditions that apply to their iCoffee Offers. In addition, our current iCoffee Offer general terms apply to all of the iCoffee Offers available through the Website and the iCoffee Application. You must always check the applicable terms and conditions before deciding to redeem a iCoffee Offer. iCoffee Partners have the discretion to refuse to honour the iCoffee Offer if you have not complied with the applicable terms and conditions.</p>
        <p>You can cancel your premium membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to all iCoffee Offers through the end of your monthly billing period.</p>
        <br>
        <p class = 'document__subtitle'>4. Charges</p>
        <p>Unless you subscribe for a premium membership, there is no charge for the use of any of the iCoffee Benefits or to become a iCoffee Member, but you should be aware that rates and fees charged by third parties (e.g., text messaging fees) may apply.</p>
        <p>If you subscribe for a premium membership you will be charged a monthly subscription fee (Subscription Fee) payable by you in accordance with these Terms and the fee schedule set out on the Website. Unless otherwise agreed, Subscriptions Fees are non-refundable. We reserve the right to change the Subscription Fee at any time upon thirty (30) days written notice by updating the fee schedule on the Website or by notifying you via email. Should you continue to use the iCoffee Benefits after these changes take effect, you will be responsible for paying the new Subscription Fee.</p>
        <p>Subscription Fees (if applicable) will be charged to your Payment Method on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your premium membership, unless agreed otherwise. You can change your Payment Method by clicking on “My Account" in the iCoffee Application or when you are signed in to the Website. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not change your Payment Method or cancel your premium membership, we may limit your access to iCoffee Offers until we have obtained a valid Payment Method. When you update your Payment Method, you authorise us to continue charging the updated Payment Method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts for periods where you have had access to the benefits of a premium membership. This may result in a change to your payment dates. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Check with your Payment Method service provider for further details.</p>
        <p>iCoffee charges iCoffee Partners for services it provides to them. These charges may in some circumstances be connected to interactions made with their customers and the success of the promotions made using the services iCoffee provides to them.</p>
